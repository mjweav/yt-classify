While most prefer to avoid the bad news that comes with bad weather, I charge towards it; intercepting tornadoes and hurricanes with my armored vehicle, the SRV Dominator, and launching trackable meteorological sensors into their strongest winds. My team has deployed probes into tornadoes using drones, small aircraft, and even rockets, gathering measurements never-before-recorded on earth. Documenting all things related to atmospheric science is my passion.  I‚Äôve been featured on the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, Netflix, The Weather Channel, Disney, PBS, AccuWeather and more! I‚Äôve been featured on Jay Leno‚Äôs Garage, and worked with the legendary Richard Hammond, from Top Gear & Grand Tour.

Their versions of ‚ÄòMisty Mountains‚Äô, ‚ÄòNancy Mulligan‚Äô, and ‚ÄòHoist The Colours‚Äô have racked up billions of views & led them to appearances on shows like Ant and Dec, Last Week Tonight, The Colbert Show & more. The group have now returned with their new album ‚ÄòNorthern Sky‚Äô. Among much-loved traditionals such as ‚ÄòWild Mountain Thyme‚Äô, ‚ÄòAmazing Grace‚Äô, and ‚ÄòRed Is The Rose‚Äô, you will find more modern songs such as Johnny Cash ‚ÄòHurt‚Äô & a lively version of ‚ÄòThe Nights'. The band also present originals ‚ÄòNorthern Sky‚Äô inspired by maritime life in the Hebrides in the 18th century, and the humorous ‚ÄòTall Tales‚Äô - a one-upmanship of the telling of wild sea adventures. Say the Wellermen: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about connection and storytelling, and we hope the listeners are able to find something meaningful.‚Äù One thing is certain: these talented men are in it for the long haul.",0.055202658153655756,0,424

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.    I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically.   Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.   I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.  Let‚Äôs GROW!",0.3584107654864232,0.2521391768943354,533

I go beyond organic gardening and work with nature rather then against it. Gardening doesn't have to be hard, and you don't have to be a servant to the garden. I can help you too create a gardening system that works with you and for you rather then you working for it. I use No pesticides, No herbicides. No fungicides, No growth hormones, No antibiotics, and No fertilizers. I allow nature to be the teacher and mimic the natural forest model to create an ideal living environment for all living things. I know their aren't a lot of people who are super excited about growing their own food, but at a time when GMO's and pesticide laden foods are causing so many health problems, I am standing in the gap showing others there is a different, and a better way!",0.3325520743390894,0.2386029879445597,707
